# Implementation Details and Architectural Changes

This document provides details about the implementation of the architectural changes and WebUI fixes in the Invoice Generator application.

## WebUI Fixes

### 1. Tax Exemption Checkbox

**Issue**: The tax exemption checkbox was initially checked when it shouldn't be, and required double-clicking to affect the footer display.

**Fix**:
- Modified event handler for the tax exemption checkbox to prevent propagation of events when using config files
- Added special handling in the form pre-fill logic to properly manage the state of the tax field
- Ensured the tax field is properly disabled/enabled based on the checkbox state

### 2. Footer Settings Inconsistencies

**Issue**: Footer checkboxes (registration info and VAT ID) did not work properly with pre-filled config files, and selecting these checkboxes automatically removed the prefill from config file.

**Fix**:
- Added special event handling for footer checkboxes to prevent them from clearing config selection
- Enhanced the footer configuration structure to properly reflect the state of checkboxes
- Improved data extraction from config files to properly handle footer settings

### 3. Company Name Issues

**Issue**: Company name always displayed "Firma GmbH" when "Show registration info" was checked, overriding custom values.

**Fix**:
- Added explicit company name handling in form submission
- Modified the backend to extract company name from the 'from' field when needed
- Ensured consistent company name usage across the application
- Updated the temporary config generation to preserve the company name

## Architectural Improvements

### 1. Package Structure Reorganization

Reorganized the code according to standard Go project layout:

- **cmd/invoice/**: Contains the main entry point (main.go)
- **internal/**: Private application code not meant for external use
  - **models/**: Data models for invoice, configuration, etc.
  - **handlers/**: HTTP request handlers for the web interface
  - **services/**: Business logic (PDF rendering, invoice generation, currency handling)
  - **config/**: Configuration loading and management
- **pkg/**: Public libraries that could be used by external applications (future use)
- **web/**: Web assets and templates
- **config/**: Configuration files

### 2. Dependency Decoupling with Interfaces

Implemented interfaces for service layer to improve testability and maintainability:

- `pdf.Renderer`: Interface for PDF generation
- `currency.Service`: Interface for currency handling
- `invoice.Service`: Interface for invoice generation and management
- `config.ConfigLoader`: Interface for configuration loading

### 3. Configuration Management

Implemented a unified configuration system with the following hierarchy:

1. Default values (hard-coded)
2. Configuration files (JSON/YAML)
3. Environment variables
4. Command-line flags

Added environment variable support with automatic mapping of structs to env vars.

### 4. Business Logic Extraction

Extracted core business logic from handlers to dedicated services:

- Moved PDF generation to `pdf.Renderer`
- Created `invoice.Service` for invoice operations
- Implemented `currency.Service` for currency handling
- Separated configuration loading to `config.ConfigLoader`

### 5. Handler Refactoring

Refactored the web handlers to use dependency injection and follow RESTful principles:

- Extracted HTTP handlers into dedicated `handlers.WebHandler`
- Implemented proper error handling and status codes
- Used dependency injection for services

## Future Enhancements

Based on this new architecture, the following enhancements can be more easily implemented:

1. **Testing**: With interfaces in place, unit tests for business logic are much easier to implement
2. **Database Integration**: Adding storage services for invoice persistence
3. **API Versioning**: Proper API version management through URL patterns
4. **Template System**: External templates for PDF and HTML output
5. **User Authentication**: Adding user management and authentication
6. **Localization**: Supporting multiple languages and regions
